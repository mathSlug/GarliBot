# GarliBot
A celebration of GarliCoin

Control a servo, LEDs, and a relay, ideally in a garlic-bread robot, from your computer using Processing and Arduino

Fun personal project to learn about Arduino serial control.
Servo opens and closes salt and cheese dispensers.
Relay controls a hot plate.
Requires manual bread placement.

#Installation
See Arduino code for which pins to use.
I used the Arduino IDE to upload to the Arduino.
You can use Processing or another tool to send Serial data.


#Requires
Processing 3
Arduino 1.8
Arduino Uno
Small servo
Cardboard
LEDs
Household current relay
USB A male to USB B male cable
Hotplate
