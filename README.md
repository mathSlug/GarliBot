Control a servo, LEDs, and a relay, ideally in a garlic-bread robot, from your computer using Processing and Arduino

Fun personal project to learn about Arduino/Processing interaction.
Servo opens and closes salt and cheese dispensers.
Relay controls a hot plate.
Requires manual bread placement.

Email me for circuit diagrams if you want. It's a pretty simple Arduino circuit, so you can probably figure it out.
