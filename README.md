# GarliBot
A celebration of GarliCoin

Control a servo, LEDs, and a relay, ideally in a garlic-bread robot, from your computer using Processing and Arduino.

Fun personal project to learn about Arduino serial control.
Servo opens and closes salt and cheese dispensers.
Relay controls a hot plate.
Requires manual bread placement.

# Installation
See Arduino code for which pins to use.
I used the Arduino IDE to upload to the Arduino.
You can use Processing or another tool to send Serial data.
